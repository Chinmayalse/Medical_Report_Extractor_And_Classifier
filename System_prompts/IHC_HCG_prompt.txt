Extract all the specified parameters and their properties from this report and present it as a JSON List as per the following template:

{
    "test": "IHC Report",
    "hospital_lab_name": "",
    "hospital_lab_location": "",
    "Patient Name":"NA",
    "parameters": [
        {
          "clinicalHistory": "Clinical history details in the report.",
          "specimen": "Specimen details, including any description of the specimen.",
          "macroscopicFindings": "Description of macroscopic findings, if present.",
          "microscopicDescription": "Description of microscopic findings, if present.",
          "impression": "Summary or diagnosis based on findings.",
          "comments": "Any additional comments, including any note within the comment section.",
          "note": "Separate note at the end of the document (distinct from comments)."
        }
    ]
}

Rules:

Extract only information directly relevant to each specified field. Ignore all other details in the document, including headers, unrelated descriptions, and any data not requested.

# CRITICAL DISTINCTION BETWEEN COMMENTS AND NOTES:
- The "comments" section should ONLY contain information from the "Comments:" section in the report
- This typically includes the PDL1 interpretation table and any additional comments like "*CPS is for research purpose only"
- Do NOT include content from the "Note:" section in the comments field
- The "note" section should ONLY contain information from the "Note:" section with bullet points

# Special instructions for handling tables in comments:
- When encountering tables (like PDL1 interpretation tables), convert them to a clear textual format
- Format each table row as a separate statement with proper punctuation
- Use periods to separate different tumor types and their interpretations
- Example format: "Non Small Cell Lung Cancer: TPS < 1% - No PDL1 expression. TPS 1-49% - PDL1 expression. TPS > 50% - High PDL1 expression."
- For each tumor type, start a new sentence with the tumor type name
- Do not use markdown table formatting or ASCII art in the output

For any distinct "note" at the document's end, extract it separately and include it in the "note" key, even if it contains similar information to the comments.

# Special instructions for handling the note section:
- IMPORTANT: Extract ONLY the note section that appears INSIDE THE MAIN TABLE with bullet points marked with 'o' symbols
- This is the note section that appears BEFORE the "Reference:" section and INSIDE the main content box/table
- DO NOT extract the note at the bottom of the page that mentions "This report is not valid for partial/divided specimens"
- The correct note section begins with "Note:" followed by bullet points about PDL1 IHC, assay validation, etc.
- This note section is typically found in the same box/table as the PDL1 interpretation table
- The note section is DISTINCT from the comments section and should not duplicate that content
- Format each bullet point as a separate paragraph with proper numbering (1., 2., etc.)
- Include the Reference section that follows the bullet points if it's part of the note section
- The note section typically contains information about:
  * FDA approval for PDL1 testing
  * Assay validation and performance details
  * Tumor cells scoring methodology
  * Tissue processing factors and limitations
  * Statements about decalcified specimens
  * Control reactivity information
- Do NOT include the table of tumor types and expression levels in the note section (that belongs in comments)

Important: Capture only the requested details in this exact JSON format. If a specific field is not found in the report, exclude that field from the JSON output rather than leaving it blank or including placeholder text.

All the Keys : clinicalHistory, specimen, macroscopicFindings, microscopicDescription, impression, comments, note
These keys should be present in the json, and no other keys should be present.

In some cases the comments section may contain a lot of text and many subheads. The subheaders would be represented by a '-' before the header name. For example: "-Note". If there is a '-' before the header name then it should be considered as a subhead which should come in this section in the json : "comments": "". The comments should include all the text starting from the start of the comments till the point where the text is "Note:" which is without the '-'. This Note would likely be towards the end of the text, with just Note with no dash('-')
Make sure to extract "References" and add it as a part of the "comments" into the json.
There might be other text blocks starting which look like: "Interpretive guide for Estrogen and Progesterone Receptor:" or "Optimal algorithm for ER/PgR testing" or "Interpretive Guide for Her-2/neu testing:" or "Scoring system : Her-2/neu" or "Optimal tissue handling guidelines:". If any of these text blocks start with any of these texts, then please add the entire text paragraph within the comments section in the json.

Important note:
Please go through the page and extract the correct Patient name, Hospital name and its location.
the address should be same as mentioned in the report.
Hospital name should be same as per the report. dont confuse it for client name.
